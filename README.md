# Check For Duplicates
This is a simple python program to identify duplicate files in one or two directories including their subfolders.
Comparison is based on filename and filesize: if two files have identical name and size, they are treated as duplicates.
Duplicate files can automatically be moved to an extra folder. In doing so, the original subfolder hierarchy will be maintained.

From the extra folder, the duplicate files can be inspected and - if desired - deleted.

This program was written to find and remove duplicate photos and videos stores in different folder hirarchies.
